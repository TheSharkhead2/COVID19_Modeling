This is a project of mine to model COVID-19 in search of answers to why what happened happened and what kinds of responses had what kinds of affects. I will also be exploring possible corelated factors with the spread of the virus being more or less in certain communities. This project is heavily inspired from a very similar project I worked on starting in a class and continuing into the summer one year ago. This project is intended to be much greater in scope and specificity than said prior project. 
This project will be using county-level from the United States. 
I will provide citations for all the data used once this project is worked on further.
