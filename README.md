This is a project of mine to model COVID-19 in search of answers to why what happened happened and what kinds of responses had what kinds of affects. I will also be exploring possible corelated factors with the spread of the virus being more or less in certain communities. 
This project will be using county-level from the United States. 
I will provide citations for all the data used once this project is worked on further.
